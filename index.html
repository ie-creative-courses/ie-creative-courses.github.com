        <h3>Welcome to Creativity lab.</h3>

<p>There are numerous books from which you can learn the grammar of the Java and JavaScript
Programming Language, including The Java™ Programming Language by Arnold,
Gosling, and Holmes [Arnold05] or The Java™ Language Specificationby Gos-ling, Joy,
JavaScript Step by Step by Steve Suehring or JavaScript Bible, Fifth Edition by Danny Goodman. 
Likewise, there are dozens of books on the libraries and APIs associated with the Java and JavaScripts programming language as well
as dozen of live and online courses which mostly oriented on getting one more certificate without real improvements of your programming skills.
</p>

<p>Our team vision is that you need to understand the
core language: is it algorithmic, functional, object-oriented? You need to know the
vocabulary: what data structures, operations, and facilities are provided by the
standard libraries? And you need to be familiar with the customary and effective
ways to structure your code. Books and major part of cources about programming languages often cover
only the first two, or discuss usage only spottily. Maybe that’s because the first
two are in some ways easier to write about. Grammar and vocabulary are proper-ties of the language alone, but usage is characteristic of a community that uses it.
</p>

<p>Our courses address your third need: customary and effective usage. Our team has spent years extending, implementing, and using the Java programming
language; we have also read a lot of other people’s code. 
We offer good advice, systematically organized, on how to
structure your code so that it works well, so that other people can understand it, so
that future modifications and improvements are less likely to cause headaches—
perhaps, even, so that your programs will be pleasant, elegant, and graceful.

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

<h3>Support or Contact</h3>

<p>Having trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at <a href="http://help.github.com/pages">http://help.github.com/pages</a> or contact <a href="mailto:support@github.com">support@github.com</a> and we’ll help you sort it out.</p>
